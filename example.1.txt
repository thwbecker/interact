This example describes a simple calculation of a slip distribution on
a planar fault given a large-scale background stress field. It is
meant to serve as an example of using "interact" for a single-step
calculation, solving for slip given stress-boundary conditions.

1) Stress boundary condition


   Interact uses a Cartesian coordinate system, and the background
   stress is read in in tensor format like 

   s_xx s_xy s_xz s_yy s_yz s_zz. 

   Say, we know the major compressive stress direction in our study
   area is N7 degrees W. We can then use the
   "calc_cart_from_eigen_stress" utility to calculate the stress
   tensor. Of course, we will have to make several assumptions about
   the principal stresses (see, e.g., the man page of
   calc_cart_from_eigen_stress, obtained by typing
   "calc_cart_from_eigen_stress -h"). Let's say we are only interested
   in relative quantities. We will assume that the max compressive
   stress (physical convention used!) is s3=-1, s1 is zero, and s2 in
   the vertical direction for simplicity. (s1 > s2 > s3 by
   definition.)

   The horizontal stress field can then be calculated using the "-ah"
   mode of calc_cart_from_eigen_stress like

   echo 0 0 0  0 -1 7 | calc_cart_from_eigen_stress -ah

   This results in max shear stress of 0.5 (say, in units of the shear
   modulus, as defined in properties.h). The output of above command
   reads 

   0 0 0   -0.985148 0.120961 0 -0.0148521 0 0

   The first three numbers are just x,y,z as repeated from the input,
   and the last six numbers are the stress tensor components as listed
   above. We want to use those numbers as input for interact, and
   hence want to create a background loading file, typically called
   "smlin.in" (see interact -l option). Since this file allows for
   linearly increasing stress like s_i = a_i + b_i * time, we have to
   provide both a_i coefficients (the numbers from above) and b_i,
   which we set to zero since we are only interested in the problem at
   time=0. The smlin.in file should hence read

    -0.985148 0
    0.120961 0 
    0 0	     
    -0.0148521 0
    0 0
    0 0


2) Patch geometry


   We need to generate a fault patch geometry for the patch input file
   geom.in. We choose to perform our calculation in a half-space in 3-D
   (as opposed to 2-D plane strain or stress). There are several ways
   to generate a patch-format file (see interact -h's description of
   the geometry input file's format). We could read in quad elements
   given on four points and fit our rectangular patches to it using
   the "points2patch" program. However, we choose to use a regular
   geometry, and want to model a fault that has 10 degree strike
   azimuth, 80 degrees dip, total length of 7, total width of 3, is
   located midpoint coordinates  x=0, y=0, z=-2. We pick a
   discretization of n=20 patches along strike and m=10 patches with
   depth. The way to generate the patch file is then to use
   "makefault" like:

   
   makefault -strike 10 -dip 80 -l 3.5 -w 1.5 -x 0 -y 0 \
      -z -2 -n 20 -m 10 > geom.in


   If we have GMT installed, we can generate a Postscript file
   visualizing the geometry by running the pgeom script in the
   interact source directory. Another option is to convert the patch
   format as in the geom.in file to the Geomview (www.geomview.org)
   3-D viewers QUAD format using the patch2geom program:

   cat geom.in | patch2geom > geom.quad

   This file can then be viewed using geomview 

   geomview geom.quad.


3) Boundary condition file

   Once we are happy with the geometry, we have to specify boundary
   conditions on each patch and define the output that interact is
   supposed to generate. This is described in some detail in the man
   page (interact -h). Here, we shall assume that we are interested in
   the stresses and displacements at the surface from x,y -15 to 15 in
   20 steps for the given background stress and completely relaxed,
   shear stress free conditions after slip in strike and dip direction
   on the patches. We tell interact about this with the following
   bc.in file (see, again, interact -h):

   
   1 1
   -15  15 20   -15 15 20   0  0 1
   -1 -1 -1 50 0

   
   The first number (1) means: run a one-step calculation (not a
   loading simulation). Second 1 is for field output requested. Next
   nine numbers define the x, y, and z limits and the nx, ny, and nz
   spacings. The last four numbers mean boundary condition "50", shear
   stress free, on all patches.

   
4)  Run interact to get the solution on the fault and in the medium.


    Typing "interact" runs the program, solves the system of
    equations, and produces the requested output. We choose to leave
    out any lithostatic, background pressure that might have been
    defined in properties.h and so use the -p flag. We also want
    simple slip distribution output for geomview, and hence use -gv.


    interact -pr 0 -gv


    The calculation of this example program took ~6s on my P4
    notebook. Interact is fairly verbose in the progress output and it
    is often a good idea to read this output to check that nothing
    went awry.
    
    The following output files are produced:

-rw-rw-r--    1 becker   becker         26 Dec 14 18:13 disp.hdr
-rw-rw-r--    1 becker   becker      36400 Dec 14 18:13 disp.out

    a) flt.dat holds stress and displacement values on the fault in a
       local coordinate system (normalized by the half-width). The file
       should look like

       and columns are locale x and y coordinates, patch area, Coulomb
       stress, dynamic friction times normal stress, strike, normal, dip
       slip components, strike, normal, and dip stresses, patch nr, and
       fault group number.


     b) flt.0.abs.off     flt.0.dip.off     flt.0.strike.off

	These files have the absolute slip and strike and dip
	component slip in Geomview COFF format, i.e. a colored version
	of the slip distribution in dip direction can be viewed by
	e.g. typing

	geomview flt.0.dip.off.


     c) disp.hdr and disp.out as well as stress.hdr and stress.out
        hold the field displacement and stress values as requested
        in the bc.in file.

        disp.hdr and stress.hdr are basically repeats of the
        geometrical field output information in bc.in, while disp.out
        is in the format x y z u_x u_y u_z. It should look like

    d) rstress.dat

    This file is meant for debugging, mostly. It lists the resolved
    strike, dip, and normal stress components on each fault patch that
    was calculated from the geometry and the stress boundary
    conditions.


Please let me know if anything is unclear.
