EISPACK is a collection of Fortran subroutines that compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of nine classes of matrices: complex general, complex Hermitian, real general, real symmetric, real symmetric banded, real symmetric tridiagonal, special real tridiagonal, generalized real, and generalized real symmetric matices. In addition, two routines are included that use singular value decomposition to solve certain least-squares problems.

EISPACK has been superseded for the most part by LAPACK.
